                        Although we started as a service-based company, ITC has grown to become a full-service
                        contracting firm, including sales, service and engineering. Offering many years of experience in
                        the automatic temperature control industry, ITC’s skilled professionals take great pride in
                        their workmanship. The company provides annual service agreements and maintenance contracts to
                        meet the unique needs of each client. Additionally, ITC’s service department consists of
                        experienced technicians who can cover all the temperature control needs for pneumatic, electric
                        and digital controls. All of ITC’s technicians have qualified factory training on major
                        manufacturer control systems and are on call 24 hours a day for emergency service.

                            In 2006, ITC was awarded a $28.3 million controls contract with the 86-acre, 110 apartment
                            complex, Peter Cooper Village in NYC, one of the largest contracts in the temperature
                            controls industry’s history. As ITC worked on the project, it made a landmark discovery — by
                            modulating steam supply temperature, they could conserve energy, save the client millions of
                            dollars on their fuel consumption bill, and maintain more consistent temperature levels for
                            the apartment residents. Because of this innovation, the project will pay for itself in four
                            to five years. ITC is in the process of securing a global patent for this innovative
                            discovery.
