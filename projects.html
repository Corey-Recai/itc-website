                                In 2006, ITC was awarded a $28.3 million controls contract with the 86-acre, 110
                                apartment
                                complex, Peter Cooper Village in NYC, one of the largest contracts in the temperature
                                controls industry’s history. As ITC worked on the project, it made a landmark discovery
                                — by
                                modulating steam supply temperature, they could conserve energy, save the client
                                millions of
                                dollars on their fuel consumption bill, and maintain more consistent temperature levels
                                for
                                the apartment residents. Because of this innovation, the project will pay for itself in
                                four
                                to five years. ITC is in the process of securing a global patent for this innovative
                                discovery.
