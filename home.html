                Based in College Point, New York, Independent Temperature Control Services, Inc. (ITC) specializes in
                providing and installing automatic temperature control systems in commercial and industrial buildings.
                The
                company’s projects range from buildings as small as 10,000 square feet to more than a million square
                feet of
                high rise construction. As a turnkey temperature control contractor, ITC is active in the retrofit,
                energy
                management and service markets. In 1984, ITC became the exclusive authorized licensee for Robertshaw
                Controls in the New York metropolitan area. Because of ITC’s high level of excellence, it was
                consistently
                rated as one of the top 10 controls contractors in the nation.

            <p class="no-top-margin">In 1994, ITC signed an agreement with Johnson Controls, making the company an
                exclusive
                Authorized Building
                Control Specialist (ABCS). Today, ITC continues to rank as one of Johnson Controls’ top ten ABCS's.
                Designing

        <div class="col s11 m11 l11">
            <p>One reason so many well-known clients turn to ITC time and again is that the company offers first-rate
                services
                customized to meet each customer’s financial needs. For example, ITC saves clients untold amounts of
                money
                by
                value engineering their projects, factoring in the cost of equipment, installation and energy
                consumption.
                By
                making these calculations during the design phase of the project, ITC often lowers both the cost of
                installation
                and energy consumption.
