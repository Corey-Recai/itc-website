                    Based in College Point, New York, Independent Temperature Control Services, Inc. (ITC) specializes
                    in
                    providing and installing automatic temperature control systems in commercial and industrial
                    buildings.
                    The
                    company’s projects range from buildings as small as 10,000 square feet to more than a million square
                    feet of
                    high rise construction. As a turnkey temperature control contractor, ITC is active in the retrofit,
                    energy
                    management and service markets. In 1984, ITC became the exclusive authorized licensee for Robertshaw
                    Controls in the New York metropolitan area. Because of ITC’s high level of excellence, it was
                    consistently
                    rated as one of the top 10 controls contractors in the nation.

                <p>In 1994, ITC signed an agreement with Johnson Controls, making the company an
                    exclusive
                    Authorized Building
                    Control Specialist (ABCS). Today, ITC continues to rank as one of Johnson Controls’ top ten ABCS's.
                    Designing
                    control systems with extreme care and expertise, ITC has developed an unparalleled reputation for
                    completing
                    projects on time and on budget.

                <p>One reason so many well-known clients turn to ITC time and again is that the company offers
                    first-rate
                    services
                    customized to meet each customer’s financial needs. For example, ITC saves clients untold amounts of
                    money
                    by
                    value engineering their projects, factoring in the cost of equipment, installation and energy
                    consumption.
                    By
                    making these calculations during the design phase of the project, ITC often lowers both the cost of
                    installation
                    and energy consumption.
