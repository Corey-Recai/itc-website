                        Based in College Point, New York, Independent Temperature Control Services, Inc. (ITC)
                        specializes
                        in
                        providing and installing automatic temperature control systems in commercial and industrial
                        buildings.
                        The
                        company’s projects range from buildings as small as 10,000 square feet to more than a million
                        square
                        feet of
                        high rise construction. As a turnkey temperature control contractor, ITC is active in the
                        retrofit,
                        energy
                        management and service markets. In 1984, ITC became the exclusive authorized licensee for
                        Robertshaw
                        Controls in the New York metropolitan area. Because of ITC’s high level of excellence, it was
                        consistently
                        rated as one of the top 10 controls contractors in the nation.

                    <p>In 1994, ITC signed an agreement with Johnson Controls, making the company an
                        exclusive

                        While indoor air quality has been an increasing concern for some time, the coronavirus outbreak
                        is bringing even more attention to the topic. Fortunately, technology is providing more options
                        to ensure better air quality and less germ transmission.

                        <span class="bold">Can Your HVAC Air Filter Kill Germs?</span><br>
                        Depending upon your HVAC system, yes to improve air quality. Some methods are designed to kill
                        germs. <br>
                        All HVAC air systems use filters to screen dust and other impurities. At their most basic, the
                        filters help your Air Handling Units perform more efficiently and last longer. Without an air
                        filter, the dust and debris can damage the coils, blower motor, and other core components. If
                        you have a return air system, you are utilizing tempered reclaimed air from the area served by
                        the Air Handling Unit.

                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">What Is A HEPA Filter?</span><br>
                        HEPA stands for High Efficiency Particulate Air. HEPA filters use thick, pleated material to
                        remove more than 99 percent of airborne particulates less than 0.3 microns in size. By filtering
                        out particles of that size or greater, HEPA filters block a variety of microorganisms, including
                        mold spores, viruses and bacteria.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">Can A HEPA Filter Kill Coronavirus?</span><br>
                        Coronavirus is technically a family of viruses. The outbreak currently sweeping the world is
                        from a novel coronavirus called COVID-19. The virus that causes COVID-19 is approximately 0.125
                        micron (125 nanometers) in diameter. It falls squarely within the particle-size range that HEPA
                        filters capture with extraordinary efficiency: 0.01 micron (10 nanometers) and above. Many media
                        outlets have incorrectly stated that HEPA filters do not filter below 0.3 micron and therefore
                        could not capture airborne coronaviruses which is false. The use of HEPA filters in your HVAC
                        system can be a highly effective tool to prevent the spread of COVID-19 as well as other air
                        borne bacteria.

                        <span class="bold">Does UV Light Kill Bacteria/Germs?</span><br>
                        Yes, ultraviolet or UV germicidal lights can destroy microorganisms and contaminants like
                        bacteria, fungus, mold, and mildew by damaging their structure. That hinders their ability to
                        grow and spread.
                        All studies conducted over a period of more than 15 years that attempted to prove the
                        effectiveness of UV-C light treatment against SARS-CoV were successful and displayed very
                        similar results, when applying the same UV germicidal light and dosage range. Furthermore,
                        recent studies showed that less than the full UV-C dose is capable of deactivating the virus to
                        non-infectious levels.

                    <p>One reason so many well-known clients turn to ITC time and again is that the company offers
                        first-rate
                        services
                        customized to meet each customer’s financial needs. For example, ITC saves clients untold
                        amounts of
                        money
                        by
                        value engineering their projects, factoring in the cost of equipment, installation and energy
                        consumption.
                        By
                        making these calculations during the design phase of the project, ITC often lowers both the cost
                        of
                        installation
                        and energy consumption.
